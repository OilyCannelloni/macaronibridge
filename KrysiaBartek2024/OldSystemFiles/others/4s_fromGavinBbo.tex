Cards face-up problem:

\handdiagramh{\hhand{AQ62}{9765}{Q}{J942}}{9}
        {\hhand{T}{Q832}{A76432}{K7}}{9}
        {\hhand{KJ54}{AKT}{K98}{A65}}{18}
        {\hhand{9873}{J4}{JT5}{QT83}}{3}
        {NS}

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{cccc}
        \nvul{W} & \vul{N} & \nvul {E} & \vul{S} \\
        \pass & \pass & 2\diams & 2\nt \\
        \pass & 3\clubs & \pass & 3\spades \\
        \pass & 4\spades & \multicolumn{2}{l}{all pass}
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Lead: J\diams. Is there any winning line of play?
\begin{center}

Our goal is to end up with,
losing, so far, at most 2 tricks.

\handdiagramh{\hhand{--}{9}{--}{J94}}{}
        {\hhand{--}{Q83}{--}{K}}{}
        {\hhand{--}{KT}{--}{A6}}{}
        {\hhand{--}{J}{--}{QT8}}{}
        {NS}

With this distribution, we can play A\clubs, K\hearts
and 6\clubs. If W ducks, we win the 10$^\text{\tiny{TH}}$ trick
with J\clubs. If he wins with Q\clubs, he is left with \clubs only
so we will win the last trick as well (with J\clubs).

So how to achieve this distribution? Take whatever E plays 
(if it is a \diams -- throw away the \hearts), ruff
the third diamond and duck a club. Then, take whatever
the opponents play (if they play \clubs or \diams the contract is already secured)
then draw trumps and here you are.

\noindent
Do you agree with 2\diams bid? 
A possibility worth considering is 3\diams bid (vulnerabilities!).
Also, the left opponent could raise the preempt.
