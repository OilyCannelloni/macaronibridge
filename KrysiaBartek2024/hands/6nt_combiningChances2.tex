West leads T\spades against 6\nt.
\begin{center}
    ***
\end{center}

We have 11 top tricks. Two finesses in the 
heart suit give 76\% chance for
the 12$^{\text{th}}$ trick, diamond suit gives 68\% chance 
(3-2 break).
We can take only one of those chances. 
However, the combined chances are:
\begin{itemize}
        \item If W holds 4 diamonds, we can finesse twice
        into the safe E's hand, succeeding if the
        honors are split (52\%).
        \item If E holds 4 diamonds, we can make the
        contract if W holds both \hearts honors (24\%).
\end{itemize}

We can find out the diamonds distribution playing 
two top diamonds first. Overall that gives us
$$68\%+32\%\cdot\frac{52\%+24\%}{2} = 80\%.$$

\newpage

Extra: if W has diamond length and W has both heart honors,
we can still try to endplay E extracting his black suits before
finessing the heart!
