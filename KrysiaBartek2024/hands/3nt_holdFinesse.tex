West leads 7\spades against 3\nt, East 
wins with the ace and returns 3\spades.

After winning the second trick we can see two chances
of takin 9 tricks: finesse in clubs and doubleton 
Q\diams -- if it drops we can use our J\diams to win
the 9$^{\text{th}}$ trick. Since the doubleton is a
safe chance
we should try it first.
If it does not drop we can still try to finesse.
If it does (16\% chance) there is no need to put
our contract in danger and finesse. Of course we would
play differently in matchpoints.
