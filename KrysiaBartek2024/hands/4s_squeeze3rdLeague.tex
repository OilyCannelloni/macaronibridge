Cards face-up problem:

\fhandp{\hhand{42}{A963}{A875}{A96}}{12}
        {\hhand{--}{Q42}{KQJT3}{Q8432}}{10}
        {\hhand{AK98753}{8}{92}{KT5}}{10}
        {\hhand{QJT6}{KJT75}{64}{J7}}{8}
        {NSWE}


Against 4\spades W leads 4\diams.
\begin{center}
    ***
\end{center}

The \twosuit{\clubs}{\diams} squeeze on E.
We play all the spades throwing out hearts in dummy.
W wins two of them. We give up the
second diamond and ruff the third. E is left
with KQ\diams and Q84\clubs and we still have two
more trumps in our hand. So we play one of them and
E is squeezed:

\fhandp{\hhand{--}{9}{8}{A96}}{}
        {\hhand{--}{--}{KQ}{Q84}}{}
        {\hhand{87}{--}{--}{KT5}}{}
        {\hhand{--}{KJT}{--}{J7}}{}
        {NSWE}
