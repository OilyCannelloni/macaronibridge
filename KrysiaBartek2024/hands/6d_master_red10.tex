West leads 7\clubs against 6\diams. You take with
an ace and draw two rounds of trumps, which turn out
to be 2-2.

It seems that the contract depends on the 
heart finesse. However, if W has K\hearts and 
4 spades, he can be endplayed. Draw all 
\twosuit{\spades}{\clubs} top tricks, ruff a 
spade and a club ending in dummy. If W hasn't show
out in spades, play your last spade. If E follows,
you have to ruff and hope for the heart finesse.
However, if E shows out, play 2\hearts (loser on loser).
W will win with the spade and will be endplayed:
