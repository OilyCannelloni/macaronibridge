# Bridge bidding system

The directory contains the notes for the bidding arrangements.

## Project structure

The root directory contains scripts used to generate SYSTEM files.

The *./SYSTEM* directory contains the generated System files.

The *./SYSTEM/config* directory contains the config files used to generate Systems.

The *./source* directory contains .tex files.

The *./docs* directory contains .pdf files with bidding system.
Each file refers to a different convention and contains bidding
arrangements with explanations and examples.

## SYSTEM creation

The system files is being created automatically from
separate system files placed in docs. To produce the SYSTEM run:
```
./makeSystem.sh config_file
```
in the terminal. As *config_file* choose one of the files from the *./SYSTEM/config* directory.

## How the SYSTEM is being created?

Each file in *./docs* contains bidding explanations and examples
regarding discussed topic. The explanations are accompanied by bare 
arrangements. The `makeSystem.sh` script extracts those arrangements
from each .tex file listed in the chosen *config_file* and puts it 
all together in SYSTEM file.

## How to create a new system?

Create a *filename.conf* file in the *./SYSTEM/config* directory.
The first line of this file should contain a title, which will be 
displayed at the beginning of the system file. The second line contains
the authors. The next line should contain the list of source file ids
that will be considered in the system. Example:
```
Title
Authors
1-15, 17, 22 - 23, 16, 15
``` 
Get the ids from the appropriate source files.

## How to change the order or titles in the SYSTEM.pdf?

The arrangements from the .tex file that are being placed in 
the SYSTEM file are bordered with comments:
```
%%% ID: 42
%%% PRIORITY: 69
%%% TITLE: JebaÄ‡ multi
%%% SYSTEM BEGIN %%%

Content

%%% SYSTEM END %%%
```

To change the title appearing in the SYSTEM or the order of contents,
change the TITLE or PRIORITY in those comments. The higher priority (smaller number)
the earlier given content will appear in the SYSTEM.

## How to produce the separate doc file?

Run:
```
./toPdf.sh filename
```
in the terminal. Write *filename* without extension. The LaTeX build files will
be placed in *./build* directory. The output file will be placed in *./docs* directory.
If you want to make pdfs from all the source files, run:
```
./toPdf.sh
```
